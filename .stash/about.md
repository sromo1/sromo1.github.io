I am a Senior AI Engineer at the AI & Data practice of Ernst & Young. I help design, develop and implement AI solutions for a wide variety of clients in different industry sectors.

Before my current role, I worked at the Financial Services Risk Management practice of EY where I provided integrated services across the production pipeline of machine learning models (dataset preparation, model design, training, testing, reporting and validation) used in risk management operations for the largest North American financial institutions.

I received my PhD in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Maryland, College Park, under the supervision of Dr. Jelena Srebric. Here is my [Thesis](https://doi.org/10.13016/8bo1-z4b6).
